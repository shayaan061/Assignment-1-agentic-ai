What is DBMS?
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages databases and provides an interface for users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.

What are the advantages of DBMS?
DBMS reduces data redundancy, improves data integrity, ensures data security, supports data sharing, and provides backup and recovery mechanisms.

What is a database?
A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically for efficient access and management.

What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

What is 1NF?
A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) if it contains only atomic values and no repeating groups.

What is 2NF?
A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if it is in 1NF and has no partial dependency on a composite primary key.

What is 3NF?
A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it is in 2NF and has no transitive dependency.

What is BCNF?
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a stronger version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

What is a primary key?
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain NULL values.

What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is an attribute that establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

What is a candidate key?
A candidate key is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table.

What is a super key?
A super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a record in a table.

What is a composite key?
A composite key consists of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify a record.

What is indexing?
Indexing is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations by creating a data structure that allows fast lookup.

What is a clustered index?
A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table and allows only one per table.

What is a non-clustered index?
A non-clustered index stores a separate structure that points to the data rows in the table.

What is a transaction?
A transaction is a sequence of database operations treated as a single logical unit of work.

What are ACID properties?
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which ensure reliable transaction processing.

What is Atomicity?
Atomicity ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none are applied.

What is Consistency?
Consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.

What is Isolation?
Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

What is Durability?
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanently stored even in case of system failure.

What is concurrency control?
Concurrency control manages simultaneous transactions without causing inconsistency.

What is deadlock?
Deadlock occurs when two or more transactions wait indefinitely for each other to release resources.

What is two-phase locking?
Two-phase locking (2PL) is a concurrency control protocol that ensures serializability by dividing execution into growing and shrinking phases.

What is a view?
A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.

What is a trigger?
A trigger is a special procedure that automatically executes in response to certain database events.

What is a stored procedure?
A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database.

What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases.

What is DDL?
DDL (Data Definition Language) includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP used to define database structure.

What is DML?
DML (Data Manipulation Language) includes commands like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.

What is DCL?
DCL (Data Control Language) includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE used for permissions.

What is TCL?
TCL (Transaction Control Language) includes commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

What is a schema?
A schema is the logical structure that defines how database objects are organized.

What is an ER model?
The Entity-Relationship model is a conceptual design model used to represent database structure using entities and relationships.

What is an entity?
An entity represents a real-world object or concept that can be uniquely identified.

What is an attribute?
An attribute describes a property or characteristic of an entity.

What is a relationship?
A relationship represents an association between two or more entities.

What is cardinality?
Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity.

What is data redundancy?
Data redundancy refers to duplication of data in multiple places.

What is data integrity?
Data integrity ensures accuracy and consistency of stored data.

What is a relational model?
The relational model represents data in the form of tables with rows and columns.

What is a tuple?
A tuple represents a single row in a relational table.

What is an attribute in relational model?
An attribute is a column in a relational table.
